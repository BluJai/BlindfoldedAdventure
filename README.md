# A Blindfolded Adventure

Blindfolded Adventure was designed during Global Game Jam 2015 (http://globalgamejam.org/2015/games/blindfolded-adventure). In this game the active, controlling player is blindfolded (in the physical world) and the secondary player provides auditory guidance on moving toward the goals on each level.
